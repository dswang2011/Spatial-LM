The need to gatherinformation and data should not be a pron contingent on an economic calculation. Moreover, it is unclear if the cost bene fit analysis needs to comply with this Bulletin? If it does, this obvious tautology appears to lead to an unending pre-assessment analysis. If not, it seems ra the rio nic and disingenuous that an economic analysis that does not have to meet any standards of quality can be used to prevent a quality assessment from being initiated. The Bulle tin forces an unconventional scientific de finition that dismisses early molecularevents as non-adverse. The Bulle tin states that, \"where human health effects are a concem, determinations of which effects are adverse shall be specific ally identified and justified...\" (V.7., p. 25). This is an inappropriate attempt to force a scientific issue and a subsequent policy decision into a dire c tion that suits OMB. The Bulle tin goesso faras to define an adverse effectas typic a lly implying \"so me func tio nal impairment orpathologic al le sion that affects the performance of the whole organism orreducesan organism's ability to withstand orrespond to additionalenvironmentalchallenges\" (p. 20). From the earliest periods of environmental law to the present, courts (e.g., lead Industrie s) have recognized that effects that are precursors of frank illness are legitimate and indeed important markers to effectuate the protective goals of environmental legislation. NRDC agrees with OMB that de line ating an adverse effect from a pre-adverse ornon-adverse effectis becoming increasingly re le vant as the scientific frontierof knowledge advances into molecular epidemiology, geno toxicology, and other sophisticated scientific are nas. It is clear now that each interaction between ourbodies and the outside environment will induce thousands of cellularand molecularresponses, and that a multi-disc ip lina ry scientific discourse will be required to identify transient or homeo static responses from those that are likely to induce permanent alterations such as cancerorneuro logicalimpairments. However, this cuts in the opposite dire c tion from the directive, suggesting that earlierpre c urso Is ratherthan later ones will be increasingly important.

Dyspareunia due to vaginal dryness appears to be most responsive to estrogen replacement therapy via restoration of vaginal cells, PH, and blood flow. ERT has been reported to enhance sexual desire in a significant number of women, although some women's sexual difficulties remain unresponsive to ERT. There also appears to be a subgroup who responds to ERT initially, but who subsequently revert to their initial problems, especially when the initial problem is loss of libido. Research supports the utility of adding androgen in this situation (Sarrel, 2000). A major barrier to research on estrogen, menopause, and sexual dysfunction is that the female sexual response is difficult to quantify objectively. The changes that occur with female sexual arousal are difficult to measure, and not always recognized by the patient. Comprehensive methods to measure female sexual function are currently under investigation (Berman et al, 1999) and the testing and validation of these methods will help address many of the complex questions that remain about this very important aspect of women's lives.

The calories in sugar are converted to energy faster than those in any other food. 10. Every 72 minutes you will normally use up as many calories as you get in a teaspoon of sugar. 11.

MRONMENT CHINA GLOBAL ENMIR Charles River Associates' Analysis Global Climate Coalition 1275 K Street, N.W., Suite 800 On Clinton Administration Assumptions Washington, D.C. 20005 On Economic Impact of the Kyoto Protocol (202)628-3622 The Clinton Administration has publicly offered optimistic assumptions about what it will take to implement the Kyoto Protocol on global warming. In reality, the cost to American families could be ten times the estimates made by the Administration because The Administration has been excessively optimistic about the likelihood of an international trading system for trading greenhouse gas emissions credits. Or. Janet Yellen, the chief White House economic advisor, has put the cost at between $14 and $23 a ton; economist W. David Montgomery of Charles River Associates found the cost could be $170 a ton or more. Under that forecast, the cost to the U.S. Gross Domestic Product will be over $100 billion, about ten times the Administrations forecast. To achieve the goals of the Kyoto Protocol, the Administration has assumed that all coal-fired electric utilities in the United States could be converted to natural gas by the year 2010 when the treaty takes hold. Dr. Montgomery found this to be unrealistic and questions whether it will be economically feasible for utility owners to make that rapid a change. Replacing coal-fired power plants with natural gas will be an enormously costly undertaking. There are many reasons - prices of trading credits abroad, lost jobs in the coal industry, limits on natural gas production. The Administration appears to have gnored all these factors. To estimate the increased costs on American families of implementing the Kyoto agreement, the Administration measured only part of the costs that which comes directly from rising energy prices. Dr. Yellen's study left the enormous indirect costs to reverberate through the whole economy. According to Dr. Montgomery, costs to American families should be multiplied by two to four times when all factors are considered. These flaws in the Administration's own analysis mean that instead of dramatically reducing its own emissions when the Kyoto treaty takes effect, the United States will instead spend billions to purchase emissions credits - mutely in Russia - to offset our own inability to meet the goals of the Protocol. That kinstond if actually cutting back on our own greenhouse emissions,and doodle, we will be forced to make a massive transfer of wealth to other countries that</s>"}, {"questionId": 62786, "answer": " 3"}, {"questionId": 62789, "answer": " abnormal"}, {"questionId": 62790, "answer": " elongated cell"}, {"questionId": 62791, "answer": ""}, {"questionId": 5448, "answer": " Kyoto Protocol"}, {"questionId": 46402, "answer": " 226th"}, {"questionId": 46406, "answer": " PRESENTED"}, {"questionId": 46410, "answer": " James T.

It endeavours to provide detailed information on various issues concerning the Company's business and financial performance to the shareholders. The spirit of Corporate Governance has prevailed in the Company and has influenced its decisions and policies. The Company firmly es in the values of transparency, professionalism and accountability in its dealings with its customers, suppliers, lenders, employees and with every individual who comes in contact with the Company. The following is the report on the status and progress made on major aspects of Corporate Governance: I) Board of Directors As on 1st April, 2001, the seven member Board comprised of four non-executive Directors of which one was a Nominee Director appointed by the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction on the Board of the Company, and the day to day affairs of the Company are managed by the Managing Director and two Whole-time Directors. During the year, Shri Sanjay Dalmia, Shri Anurag Dalmia and Shri R. R. Kumar, non-executive Directors resigned resulting in the Board comprising of four independent Directors, three executive and a non-executive Nominee Director. The Company had been earnestly trying to contact eminent personalities and professionals to join the Board of the Company and comply with the provisions of Clause 49 pertaining to Corporate Governance. But due to disqualification contemplated under Section 274(1)(g) of the Companies Act, 1956, the Company had difficulty in appointing non-executive Directors on the Board of the Company. However due to consistent efforts of the Company, three more non-executive Directors, Shri M. H. Patil, Shri Bharat B. Merchant and Shri R. A. Gupta were appointed on the Board at its meeting held on 26th July, 2002. The Company had received letter from the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction intimating cessation of office of Dr. P. L. Malhotra as the Special Director on the Board of the Company effective from 26th July, 2002.
