The need to gatherinformation and data should not be a pron contingent on an economic calculation. Moreover, it is unclear if the cost bene fit analysis needs to comply with this Bulletin? If it does, this obvious tautology appears to lead to an unending pre-assessment analysis. If not, it seems ra the rio nic and disingenuous that an economic analysis that does not have to meet any standards of quality can be used to prevent a quality assessment from being initiated. The Bulle tin forces an unconventional scientific de finition that dismisses early molecularevents as non-adverse. The Bulle tin states that, \"where human health effects are a concem, determinations of which effects are adverse shall be specific ally identified and justified...\" (V.7., p. 25). This is an inappropriate attempt to force a scientific issue and a subsequent policy decision into a dire c tion that suits OMB.

From the earliest periods of environmental law to the present, courts (e.g., lead Industrie s) have recognized that effects that are precursors of frank illness are legitimate and indeed important markers to effectuate the protective goals of environmental legislation. NRDC agrees with OMB that de line ating an adverse effect from a pre-adverse ornon-adverse effectis becoming increasingly re le vant as the scientific frontierof knowledge advances into molecular epidemiology, geno toxicology, and other sophisticated scientific are nas. It is clear now that each interaction between ourbodies and the outside environment will induce thousands of cellularand molecularresponses, and that a multi-disc ip lina ry scientific discourse will be required to identify transient or homeo static responses from those that are likely to induce permanent alterations such as cancerorneuro logicalimpairments. However, this cuts in the opposite dire c tion from the directive, suggesting that earlierpre c urso Is ratherthan later ones will be increasingly important.

OMB and the sponsoring agencies (Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Labor, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration) requested that the National Research Council (NRC) conduct a scientific review of the bulletin. In this report, the NRC's Committee to Review the OMB Risk Assessment Bulletin provides its assessment of the OMB bulletin. The committee evaluates the standards presented in the bulletin, comments on the impact of the bulletin on the practice of risk assessment in the federal government, identifies critical elements missing from the bulletin, evaluates the consistency of the bulletin with previous reports of NRC and other organizations, and determines whether the draft bulletin has met OMB's stated objective. This report has been reviewed in draft form by persons chosen for their diverse perspectives and technical expertise in accordance with procedures approved by NRC's Report Review Committee. The purpose of this independent review is to provide candid and critical comments that will assist the institution in making its published report as sound as possible and to ensure that the report meets institutional standards of objectivity, evidence, and responsiveness to the study charge. The review comments and draft manuscript remain confidential to protect the integrity of the deliberation process.

This would either prove or disprove the possibility of retaining the physician on a full-time basis. Before we attempt to hire full-time physicians, we must realize two factors : 1. How many full-time physician positions do we currently have and how many are being utilized. 2. I's it possible to build in the full-time physician concept into our present departmental structure. It was stated that there are four full-time physician items in the Venereal Disease Control Division at present which have thus far been staffed with as-needed physicians because full-time physicians have been impossible to find. Another problem at the present time is that for at least one month, there has been a vacant Sr. Public Health Physician item in one particular district because (1) there is no Civil Service list for physicians; and (2) full-time physicians are simply not interested. One reason for this difficulty is the fact that we now compete with other County Departments for full-time physicians. The reason for this competition is that the salaries for physicians in other depart- ments are higher -- an example being the Department of Hospitals. This is justified by the \"round the clock\" need for physicians in other departments. This factor is a definite disadvantage to this department. The main concern at this time should be with the Health Officer's response to the generalist physician concept. It was decided not to further discuss the generalist concept until word from the Health Officer at next week's meeting.

Clearly the tax policy of placing the majority of the excise burden on cigarettes has not achieved its stated social objective of decreasing tobacco consumption, nor has the Government been able to optimize the revenue collected as a result of the declining tax base. With globalisation of the Indian market, discriminatory taxation will result in an increasing percentage of the tobacco market going to illegal 320 38B imports.

The significance of the impact of the taxation policy on Indian cigarettes is best illustrated when we compare our closest neighbour China and look at its cigarette tax and total tax collection (see the table below): Source: The Tobacco Institute of India A more equitable tax China. Tax Revenue base must be established for all tobacco products, reducing the discriminatory gap between cigarette and non-cigarette tobacco products.

Act, 2003 imposing advertising pans, product labeling and other restrictions only on domestic tobacco, further discriminates domestic Source: The Tobacco Institute of India cigarette brands against imported products. Advertising and promotion of imported brands is seen on cable television in India allowing promotion of their products over domestic cigarette brands. The Act's ban on tobacco sales within 100 yards of educational institutions will cause significant dislocation in the retail and farming sector and result in loss of income given the density of population in India. Of greater concern, it will encourage illegal sales in these areas. Both the discriminatory taxation and marketing regulations imposed on the domestic cigarette industry will further erode the value of the domestic industry, reduce the government taxation base by encouraging cheaper foreign brands or contraband, reduce tobacco farm income, as more products are supplied from overseas, adding to unemployment. All this without reducing overall tobacco consumption.
